# Houston Incidents Map

[![Scrape, build, and deploy](https://github.com/c360e5f1/houstonincidents.com/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c360e5f1/houstonincidents.com/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

Web page for incidents involving Houston Fire and Houston Police. Works on mobile and desktop. ~~Includes manifest as a progressive web app.~~

```main.sh``` runs as a bash script to pull JSON data from the Houston ArcGIS server. The JSON data is then parsed for relevant information, like the latitude/longitude, incident information, response type, etc, and plots it on a basic HTML page using OpenStreetMaps and Leaflet.

You can run this locally and use ```./web/index.html``` as the web page, or run it as a GitHub Workflow that exports to GitHub Pages. If run as a GitHub workflow, the cron can be configured to run every five minutes, but [due to instance queueing](https://upptime.js.org/blog/2021/01/22/github-actions-schedule-not-working/) realistically will only run a few times an hour. The source ArcGIS instance only updates at five minute intervals.
